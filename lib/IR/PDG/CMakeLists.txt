# Program Dependency Graph (PDG) CMake configuration
#
# This file configures the build for the PDG module, which implements
# a comprehensive program dependency graph for LLVM-based analysis.
# 
# The PDG system provides:
# - Field-sensitive program dependence analysis
# - Context-insensitive interprocedural analysis
# - Support for both control and data dependencies
# - Structural analysis for C programs
