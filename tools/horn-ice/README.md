About the benchamark: "The third benchmark suite consists of 45 sequential programs without recursion taken from Dillig et al.. Our aim here is to evaluate the performance of our technique as a solver for constraint Horn clauses (CHCs). To this end, we first generated CHCs of the programs in Dillig et al.â€™s benchmarks suite using SeaHorn. Then, we compared Horn-DT-CHC with Z3/PDR, a state-of-the-art CHC solver.".

The benchmarks are also called "HOLA" in some papers.
