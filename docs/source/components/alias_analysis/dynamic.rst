Dynamic Alias Analysis
=====================

The Dynamic Alias Analysis is a runtime-based alias analysis that captures actual memory usage during program execution to determine pointer relationships.

Overview
--------

Unlike static alias analyses, Dynamic Alias Analysis relies on program instrumentation and runtime memory access information to build precise alias relationships. This approach provides high precision by observing actual program behavior rather than approximating it through static code analysis.

Components
----------

The Dynamic Alias Analysis consists of several key components:

- **DynamicAliasAnalysis**: Core analysis engine that processes memory logs and builds alias relationships
- **MemoryInstrument**: Instruments LLVM IR to track memory allocations and pointer operations
- **MemoryHooks**: Runtime hooks that capture memory-related events during execution
- **LogReader/LogPrinter**: Tools for reading and debugging memory logs
- **IDAssigner**: Assigns unique identifiers to program entities for tracking

How It Works
-----------

1. The program is instrumented to include memory hooks that track allocations, pointer operations, and function calls.
2. During execution, these hooks generate a log of memory operations.
3. The log is processed by the DynamicAliasAnalysis to determine which pointers alias.
4. Alias information is organized by function and can be queried to determine if two pointers may point to the same memory.

The analysis is particularly useful for:

- Generating ground truth for evaluating static alias analyses
- Debugging memory-related issues
- Supporting precise analyses in cases where static approximations are too conservative

Usage
-----

To use the Dynamic Alias Analysis:

1. Instrument your program using the MemoryInstrument pass
2. Execute the instrumented program to generate a memory log
3. Process the log using DynamicAliasAnalysis

Example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // Initialize the analysis with a log file
   dynamic::DynamicAliasAnalysis analysis("memory_log.txt");
   
   // Run the analysis
   analysis.runAnalysis();
   
   // Query alias information
   if (analysis.mayAlias(ptrA, ptrB)) {
       // Pointers may alias
   }

Limitations
----------

- Requires program execution, which may not explore all possible paths
- Depends on the quality and coverage of the test cases used for execution
- Adds runtime overhead due to instrumentation
