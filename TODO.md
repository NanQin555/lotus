# Development

For Summer Research, Final Year Project Topics, etc.

## 1. Testing Improvements

- Different OS, LLVM, Z3, Boost, etc.
- Use lib/Alias/Dynamic to test pointer analyses.

## 2. Alias Analysis

### Infrastructure

- Specificatin: use lib/Annotation to enable the loading of aliasing specification files for the pointer analyses (And perhpas use dynamic analysis/ML to extract specifications)
- Data structure: integrate different representations of points-to sets.

### Interfaces

Universal Interface for the analyses in lib/Alias: 

- Basics: points-to, alias pair, alias set, pointed-by, - Callgraph, memory dependence, etc.


### Third-Party

* Integrate the pointer analyses in SVF and DG


## 3. Intermediate Representations (IR) 

### VFG (Value Flow Graph)

The DyckAA module has a DyckVFG, which is used by the null pointer analysis (lib/NullPointer).
Maybe we can design a VFG independent from DyckAA (e.g., it can use the results of other pointer analyses)

### PDG (Program Dependence Graph)

* Use the pointer analysis interfaces (currently, it relies on the memory dependence analysis inside LLVM)

## 4. Applications 

### Slicing

Use VFG or PDG to answer slicing queries.

* Forward slicing
* Backward slicing
* Program chopping
* Thin slicing

(Maybe refer to the implementation in DG)

### Bug

- Null pointer analysis (lib/NullPointer)
- Buffer overflow detection?
- Memory leak detection?
- Race condition analysis?


## 5. Numerical Analysis

* Integrate abstract interpretation frameworks (e.g., IKOS, CLAM/Crab)

## 6. Data Flow Analysis

* Revise the current data flow analysis module
